# MeTTa-Driven Knowledge Graph Service With LLM Integration

## Overview

This repository hosts the codebase and documentation for the MeTTa-Driven Knowledge Graph Service with Large Language Model (LLM) Integration. This project is part of the SingularityNET platform (Round 4 of the Beta SNET RFPs). The goal is to develop a service that integrates a custom knowledge graph builder with LLM capabilities, enabling natural language querying and intelligent insights extraction through Neo4j.

## Project Description

### Contribution to Decentralized AI Platform

The project aims to enhance the capabilities of the SingularityNET platform by introducing an advanced Knowledge Graph Service integrated with LLMs. This service will enable users to interact with complex data through natural language, making advanced data analysis more accessible and user-friendly. Key components include:

- **Neo4j for Knowledge Graph Management:** Efficient management and querying of knowledge graphs.
- **LLMs for Data Preprocessing:** Enhanced data interpretation and preprocessing capabilities.
- **SingularityNET's AI Services Integration:** Seamless integration with existing AI services on the platform.
- **MeTTa-Motto Library:** Utilization of the MeTTa-Motto library for data processing and query interpretation.

### Problem Statement

The primary challenge of the project addresses is the complexity and inaccessibility of sophisticated data analysis for non-technical users. Current methods require specialized knowledge, limiting the user base. Our service aims to democratize access to this data by providing an intuitive natural language interface.

### Solution

The solution is a custom Knowledge Graph Service that leverages LLMs for natural language processing, integrated with Neo4j. This service will preprocess data from the Standard Template Construct for ingestion into Neo4j, allowing users to build custom knowledge graphs. The integrated LLM will interpret natural language queries and convert them into queries for Neo4j, facilitating intelligent data exploration.
